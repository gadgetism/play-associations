h1. [associations] Automatic bi-directional associations

_Enhances all your model classes with automated bi-directional associations._

This module will automatically enhance all your bi-directional JPA associations (those with "mappedBy" annotations) to heal you from the pain to keep both sides of one relationship in sync.

As usual in play, it works transparently behind the scenes, completely effortless for you.
